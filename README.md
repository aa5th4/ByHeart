## Problem Statement
"Using blockchain technology to restore some of the lost credibility to charities that prove worthy of the public’s trust."

The Blockchain build trust with donors, recipients, and other stakeholders reach the right people and improve administration costs and efficacy. blockchain solutions can enable charities and non-profits to deliver results in entirely novel ways that would be impossible without the blockchain.

**Basis of the problem statement**

The term “charity” has been used and abused, and much of the public is no longer willing to take charities’ word as bond. Charities face declining donations among the young, increasing skepticism over CEO pay and concerns about where donations end up. At the same time, they struggle with inefficient, underfunded administration, often can’t direct aid adequately and frequently see the most vulnerable and needy miss-out.
We are intending to resurrect the images of charities willing to adopt its services with the help of blockchain technology. The Blockchain build trust with donors, recipients, and other stakeholders reach the right people and improve administration costs and efficacy.
